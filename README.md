üìñ Overview
This project focuses on the classic machine learning problem of handwritten digit recognition using the famous MNIST dataset. The goal is to build and train a model that can accurately classify images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

This implementation uses a Jupyter Notebook to walk through the process of data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

üíæ Dataset
The project utilizes the MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset, a large database of handwritten digits commonly used for training and testing in the field of machine learning.

Training Set: 60,000 images

Testing Set: 10,000 images

Image Size: 28x28 pixels, grayscale

The dataset is loaded directly via the sklearn.datasets module, so no manual download is required.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Libraries Used
Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

Scikit-learn: For machine learning models and utilities.

NumPy: For numerical operations and handling arrays.

Matplotlib: For data visualization and plotting the digit images.

üöÄ How to Get Started
Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You will also need Jupyter Notebook.

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/farhann-saleem/Mnist-classification.git](https://github.com/farhann-saleem/Mnist-classification.git)
cd Mnist-classification

Install the required libraries:
For a streamlined setup, you can create a requirements.txt file with the following content:

numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
jupyter

Then, install all dependencies with a single command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Running the Project
Launch Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook

Open the notebook:
Once the Jupyter environment opens in your browser, navigate to and open the mnist.ipynb file.

Execute the cells:
You can run the notebook cells sequentially to see the entire process, from data loading to model evaluation.

ü§ñ Model & Results
The project uses a simple yet effective machine learning model for classification. The specific model and its performance are detailed within the notebook. By running the notebook, you can see:
