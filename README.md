📖 About The Project
This repository provides a complete walkthrough for building a handwritten digit classifier. Instead of a long paragraph, here's the breakdown:

🎯 Goal: To accurately classify images of handwritten digits (0-9).

💾 Dataset: Uses the famous MNIST dataset (60k training, 10k testing images).

⚙️ Method: A Jupyter Notebook (mnist.ipynb) guides you through each stage:

Data Loading & Exploration

Data Preprocessing

Model Training

Performance Evaluation

💡 Purpose: A foundational project for anyone starting in machine learning or computer vision.

🛠️ Built With
This project leverages the following core technologies:

Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

Scikit-learn

NumPy

Matplotlib

🚀 Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3 and pip installed on your system.

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/farhann-saleem/Mnist-classification.git](https://github.com/farhann-saleem/Mnist-classification.git)
cd Mnist-classification

Install dependencies:
A requirements.txt is recommended for a smooth setup. Create the file and then run the install command.

pip install -r requirements.txt

(If you don't have the file, you can install packages individually: pip install numpy scikit-learn matplotlib jupyter)

Running the Notebook
Launch Jupyter Notebook from your terminal:

jupyter notebook

Open mnist.ipynb in the Jupyter interface that opens in your browser.

Run the cells top-to-bottom to execute the project.

📊 Results
The performance of the model is detailed within the notebook, including:

✅ Accuracy Score: A quantitative measure of the model's correctness.

🔀 Confusion Matrix: A visual breakdown of correct vs. incorrect predictions for each digit.

👀 Prediction Examples: See which digits the model got right and which it struggled with.
